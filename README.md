## 🎯 Learning Goals

Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

Work with stdin / stdout for user interaction

Practice managing Lists (adding, removing, updating)

Build a simple but functional console-based project

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

Save tasks to a file so they persist after program exit

Add the ability to edit task names

Support multiple users (separate task lists per user)

Write unit tests to validate core functionality
